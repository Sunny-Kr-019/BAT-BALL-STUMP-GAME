# About Game

The Bat-Ball-Stump Game is a fun and interactive game inspired by the classic Rock-Paper-Scissors concept, but with a cricket twist. In this game, players choose between Bat, Ball, or Stump, and the computer randomly selects one as well. The winner is determined based on predefined rules:

- Bat beats Ball (because a bat can hit the ball)
- Ball beats Stump (because a ball can knock down the stump)
- Stump beats Bat (because a stump can stop the bat from hitting)


Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this game provides an engaging and visually appealing experience with simple yet dynamic gameplay. Itâ€™s a great way for cricket lovers to enjoy a quick and fun challenge while testing their luck and strategy.
